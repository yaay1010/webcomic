                So, it was a pretty **cking bad day, and I just went to play minecraft, not knowing what s**t i was going to get into. mainly, I learned more things about minecraft then math in school. I thought, "wtf coronavirus! i learn nothing in school because of you!" So, yeah. Thats pretty embarrasing. Tbh i have no idea when to do anything anymore. I am tired. By the way this comic series was inspired by Dog Man by Dav Pilsky, which I read in school twice. Please do not take this comic seriously as these events are made u- well, some are. please enjoy my comic and I'll see you in part 2. Bye!!
